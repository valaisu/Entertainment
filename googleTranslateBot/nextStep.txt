The improved version of this bot would communicate
with google using packets. However, after further inspection,
this does seem like a rather difficult task. A single click
in google translate sends 27 packets, and I can't find where
the important information is stored

UPDATE:

It seems like the link is important. Most if not all the
important data is stored in the link!
