The original goal was to teach some kind of ML AI to play CIV6, or more specifically master the comabt between small armies.
The AI part proved somewhat difficult, so I will return to this when I am wiser. The battle simulator part works though. 

The program itself consists of three parts
Game Logic
  Data about the board, units, whose turn it is etc
GUI
  Graphically represents the above
Units
  Assigns the stats and graphics to the units
